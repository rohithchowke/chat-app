I propose to consider first the various elements of the subject, next its vari-  ous parts or sections, and finally the whole in its internal structure. In other  words, I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more  than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the  whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always  be thought of together.  2. DEFINITION  I shall not begin by expounding a pedantic, literary definition of war, but ', ' go straight to the heart of the matter, to the duel. War is nothing but a  duel on a larger scale. Countless duels go to make up war, but a picture of  it as a whole can be formed by imagining a pair of wrestlers. Each tries  through physical force to compel the other to do his will; his immediate  aim is to throw his opponent in order to make him incapable of further  resistance.  War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.  Force, to counter opposing force, equips itself w', 'ith the inventions of art  and science. Attached to force are certain self-imposed, imperceptible limita-  tions hardly worth mentioning, known as international law and custom,  but they scarcely weaken it. Force-that is, physical force, for moral force  has no existence save as expressed in the state and the law-is thus the  means of war; to impose our will on the enemy is its object. To secure that  object we must render the enemy powerless; and that, in theory, is the true  aim of warfare. Th', 'at aim takes the place of the object, discarding it as  something not actually part of war itself.  Kind-hearted people might of course think there was some ingenious way to  disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed, and might imagine  this is the true goal of the art of war. Pleasant as it sounds, it is a fallacy  that must be exposed: war is such a dangerous business that the mistakes  which come from kindness are the very worst. The maximum use of force  is in no way incompatible ', 'with the simultaneous use of the intellect. If  one side uses force without compunction, undeterred by the bloodshed it  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  involves, while the other side refrains, the first will gain the upper hand.  That side will force the other to follow suit; each will drive its opponent  toward extremes, and the only limiting factors are the counterpoises inherent  in war.  This is how the matter must be seen. It would be futile-even wrong-  to', \" try and shut one's eyes to what war really is from sheer distress at its  brutality.  If wars between civilized nations are far less cruel and destructive than  wars between savages, the reason lies in the social conditions of the states  themselves and in their relationships to one another. These are the forces  that give rise to war; the same forces circumscribe and moderate it. They  themselves however are not part of war; they already exist before fighting  starts. To introduce the principl\", 'e of moderation into the theory of war itself  would always lead to logical absurdity.  Two different motives make men fight one another: hostile feelings and  hostile intentions. Our definition is based on the latter, since it is the uni-  versal element. Even the most savage, almost instinctive, passion of hatred  cannot be conceived as existing without hostile intent; but hostile intentions  are often unaccompanied by any sort of hostile feelings-at least by none  that predominate. Savage peo', 'ples are ruled by passion, civilized peoples by  the mind. The difference, however, lies not in the respective natures of  savagery and civilization, but in their attendant circumstances, institutions,  and so forth. The difference, therefore, does not operate in every case, but  it does in most of them. Even the most civilized of peoples, in short, can be  fired with passionate hatred for each other.  Consequently, it would be an obvious fallacy to imagine war between  civilized peoples as resu', 'lting merely from a rational act on the part of their  governments and to conceive of war as gradually ridding itself of passion,  so that in the end one would never really need to use the physical impact of  the fighting forces--comparative figures of their strength would be enough.  That would be a kind of war by algebra.  Theorists were already beginning to think along such lines when the  recent wars taught them a lesson. If war is an act of force, the emotions  cannot fail to be involved. W', 'ar may not spring from them, but they will  still affect it to some degree, and the extent to which they do so will depend  not on the level of civilization but on how important the conflicting interests  are and on how long their conflict lasts.  If, then, civilized nations do not put their prisoners to death or devastate  cities and countries, it is because intelligence plays a larger part in their  methods of warfare and has taught them more effective ways of using force  than the crude expre', 'ssion of instinct.  The invention of gunpowder and the constant improvement of firearms  are enough in themselves to show that the advance of civilization has done  nothing practical to alter or deflect the impulse to destroy the enemy, which  is central to the very idea of war.  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER ONE  The thesis, then, must be repeated: war is an act of force, and there is no  logical limit to the application of that force. Each side, therefore, comp', 'els  its opponent to follow suit; a reciprocal action is started which must lead,  in theory, to extremes. This is the @st case of interaction and the first  \"extreme\" we meet with.  I have already said that the aim of warfare is to disarm the enemy and it is  time to show that, at least in theory, this is bound to be so. If the enemy is  to be coerced you must put him in a situation that is even more unpleasant  than the sacrifice you call on him to make. The hardships of that situation  must n', 'ot of course be merely transient-at least not in appearance. Other-  wise the enemy would not give in but would wait for things to improve. Any  change that might be brought about by continuing hostilities must then, at  least in theory, be of a kind to bring the enemy still greater disadvantages.  The worst of all conditions in which a belligerent can find himself is to be  utterly defenseless. Consequently, if you are to force the enemy, by making  war on him, to do your bidding, you must eith', 'er make hin literally defense-  less or at least put him in a position that makes this danger probable. It  follows, then, that to overcome the enemy, or disarm him--call it what you  will-must always be the aim of warfare.  War, however, is not the action of a living force upon a lifeless mass  (total nonresistance would be no war at all) but always the collision of two  living forces. The ultimate aim of waging war, as formulated here, must be  taken as applying to both sides. Once again, ther', 'e is interaction. So long as  I have not overthrown my opponent I am bound to fear he may overthrow  me. Thus I am not in control: he dictates to me as much as I dictate to him.  This is the second case of interaction and it leads to the second \"extreme.\"  If you want to overcome your enemy you must match your effort against his  power of resistance, which can be expressed as the product of two inseparable  factors, viz. the total means at his disposal and the strength of his will. The  extent o', \"f the means at his disposal is a matter-though not exclusively--of  figures, and should be measurable. But the strength of his will is much less  easy to determine and can only be gauged approximately by the strength of  the motive animating it. Assuming you arrive in this way at a reasonably  accurate estimate of the enemy's power of resistance, you can adjust your  own efforts accordingly; that is, you can either increase them until they  surpass the enemy's or, if this is beyond your means, y\", 'ou can make your  efforts as great as possible. But the enemy will do the same; competition  will again result and, in pure theory, it must again force you both to  extremes. This is the third case of interaction and the third \"extreme.\"  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  Thus in the field of abstract thought the inquiring mind can never rest until  it reaches the extreme, for here it is dealing with an extreme: a clash of  forces freely operating and obedient to n', 'o law but their own. From a pure  concept of war you might try to deduce absolute terms for the objective you  should aim at and for the means of achieving it; but if you did so the con-  tinuous interaction would land you in extremes that represented nothing  but a play of the imagination issuing from an almost invisible sequence of  logical subtleties. If we were to think purely in absolute terms, we could  avoid every difficulty by a stroke of the pen and proclaim with inflexible  logic that,', ' since the extreme must always be the goal, the greatest effort  must always be exerted. Any such pronouncement would be an abstraction  and would leave the real world quite unaffected.  Even assuming this extreme effort to be an absolute quantity that could  easily be calculated, one must admit that the human mind is unlikely to  consent to being ruled by such a logical fantasy. It would often result in  strength being wasted, which is contrary to other principles of statecraft.  An effort of w', 'ill out of all proportion to the object in view would be needed  but would not in fact be realized, since subtleties of logic do not motivate  the human will.  But move from the abstract to the real world, and the whole thing looks  quite different. In the abstract world, optimism was all-powerful and forced  us to assume that both parties to the conflict not only sought perfection but  attained it. Would this ever be the case in practice? Yes, it would if: (a)  war were a wholly isolated act, o', 'ccurring suddenly and not produced by  previous events in the political world; (b) it consisted of a single decisive act  or a set of simultaneous ones; (c) the decision achieved was complete and  perfect in itself, uninfluenced by any previous estimate of the political situa-  tion it would bring about.  As to the first of these conditions, it must be remembered that neither  opponent is an abstract person to the other, not even to the extent of that  factor in the power of resistance, namely t', 'he will, which is dependent on  externals. The will is not a wholly unknown factor; we can base a forecast  of its state tomorrow on what it is today. War never breaks out wholly  unexpectedly, nor can it be spread instantaneously. Each side can therefore  gauge the other to a large extent by what he is and does, instead of judging  him by what he, strictly speaking, ought to be or do. Man and his affairs.  however, are always something short of perfect and will never quite achieve  the absolute', ' best. Such shortcomings affect both sides alike and therefore  constitute a moderating force.  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER ONE  The second condition calls for the following remarks:  If war consisted of one decisive act, or of a set of simultaneous decisions,  preparations would tend toward totality, for no omission could ever be  rectified. The sole criterion for preparations which the world of reality could  provide would be the measures taken by the adversa', 'ry-so far as they are  known; the rest would once more be reduced to abstract calculations. But  if the decision in war consists of several successive acts, then each of them,  seen in context, will provide a gauge for those that follow. Here again, the  abstract world is ousted by the real one and the trend to the extreme is  thereby moderated.  But, of course, if all the means available were, or could be, simultaneously  employed, all wars would automatically be confined to a single decisive a', 'ct  or a set of simultaneous ones-the reason being that any adverse decision  must reduce the sum of the means available, and if all had been committed  in the first act there could really be no question of a second. Any subsequent  military operation would virtually be part of the first-in other words, merely  an extension of it.  Yet, as I showed above, as soon as preparations for a war begin, the world  of reality takes over from the world of abstract thought; material calculations  take the ', 'place of hypothetical extremes and, if for no other reason, the inter-  action of the two sides tends to fall short of maximum effort. Their full  resources will therefore not be mobilized immediately.  Besides, the very nature of those resources and of their employment means  they cannot all be deployed at the same moment. The resources in question  are the fighting forces proper, the country, with its physical features and pop-  ulation, and its allies.  The country-its physical features and p', 'opulation-is more than just the  source of all armed forces proper; it is in itself an integral element among  the factors at work in war-though only that part which is the actual theater  of operations or has a notable influence on it.  It is possible, no doubt, to use all mobile fighting forces simultaneously;  but with fortresses, rivers, mountains, inhabitants, and so forth, that cannot  be done; not, in short, with the country as a whole, unless it is so small that  the opening action of th', 'e war completely engulfs it. Furthermore, allies do  not cooperate at the mere desire of those who are actively engaged in fight-  ing; international relations being what they are, such cooperation is often  furnished only at some later stage or increased only when a balance has been  disturbed and needs correction.  In many cases, the proportion of the means of resistance that cannot  immediately be brought to bear is much higher than might at first be  thought. Even when great strength has bee', 'n expended on the first decision  and the balance has been badly upset, equilibrium can be restored. The  point will be more fully treated in due course. At this stage it is enough to  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}.

And even if the first clash is  not the only one, the influence it has on subsequent actions will be on a  scale proportionate to its own. But it is contrary to human nature to make  an extreme effort, and the tendency therefore is always to plead that a deci-  sion may be possible later on. As a result, for the first decision, effort and  concentration of forces are not all they might be. Anything omitted out of  weakness by one side becomes a real, objective reason fo', 'r the other to reduce  its efforts, and the tendency toward extremes is once again reduced by this  interaction.  Lastly, even the ultimate outcome of a war is not always to be regarded as  final. The defeated state often considers the outcome merely as a transitory  evil, for which a remedy may still be found in political conditions at some  later date. It is obvious how this, too, can slacken tension and reduce the  vigor of the effort.  Warfare thus eludes the strict themetical requirement th', 'at extremes of force  be applied. Once the extreme is no longer feared or aimed at, it becomes a  matter of judgment what degree of effort should be made; and this can only  be based on the phenomena of the real world and the laws of probability.  Once the antagonists have ceased to be mere figments of a theory and  become actual states and governments, when war is no longer a theoretical  affair but a series of actions obeying its own peculiar laws, reality supplies  the data from which we can ', \"deduce the unknown that lies ahead.  From the enemy's character, from his institutions, the state of his affair:  and his general situation, each side, using the laws of probability, forms an  estimate of its opponent's likely course and acts accordingly.  A subject which we last considered in Section 2 now forces itself on us again,  namely the political object of the war. Hitherto it had been rather over-  shadowed by the law of extremes, the will to overcome the enemy and make  him powerless.\", ' But as this law begins to lose its force and as this determina-  tion wanes, the political aim will reassert itself. If it is all a calculation of  probabilities based on given individuals and conditions, the political object,  which was the original motive, must become an essential factor in the equa-  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}.

The smaller the penalty you demand from your opponent, the less you  can expect him to try and deny it to you; the small', 'er the effort he makes,  the less you need make yourself. Moreover, the more modest your own  political aim, the less importance you attach to it and the less reluctantly  you will abandon it if you must. This is another reason why your effort wzll  be modified.  The political object-the original motive for the war-will thus determine  both the military objective to be reached and the amount of effort it requires.  The political object cannot, however, in itself provide the standard of  measurem', 'ent. Since we are dealing with realities, not with abstractions, it  can do so only in the context of the two states at war. The same political  object can elicit differing reactions from different peoples, and even from  the same people at different times. We can therefore take the political object  as a standard only if we think of the influence it can exert upon the forces  it is meant to move. The nature of those forces therefore calls for study.  Depending on whether their characteristics i', 'ncrease or diminish the drive  toward a particular action, the outcome will vary. Between two peoples and  two states there can be such tensions, such a mass of inflammable material,  that the slightest quarrel can produce a wholly disproportionate effect-a  real explosion.  This is equally true of the efforts a political object is expected to arouse  in either state, and of the military objectives which their policies require.  Sometimes the political and military objective is the same-for exam', 'ple, the  conquest of a province. In other cases the political object will not provide  a suitable military objective. In that event, another military objective must  be adopted that will serve the political purpose and symbolize it in the peace  negotiations. But here, too, attention must be paid to the character of  each state involved. There are times when, if the political object is to be  achieved, the substitute must be a good deal more important. The less  involved the population and the ', 'less serious the strains within states and  between them, the more political requirements in themselves will dominate  and tend to be decisive. Situations can thus exist in which the political object  will almost be the sole determinant.  Generally speaking, a military objective that matches the political object  in scale will, if the latter is reduced, be reduced in proportion; this will be  all the more so as the political object increases its predominance. Thus it  follows that without any in', 'consistency wars can have all degrees of impor-  tance and intensity, ranging from a war of extermination down to simple  armed observation. This brings us to a different question, which now needs  to be analyzed and answered.  However modest the political demands may be on either side, however small  the means employed, however limited the military objective, can the process  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  of war ever be interrupted, even for a moment? The ques', 'tion reaches deep  into the heart of the matter.  Every action needs a certain time to be completed. That period is called  its duration, and its length will depend on the speed with which the person  acting works. We need not concern ourselves with the difference here.  Everyone performs a task in his own way; a slow man, however, does not  do it more slowly because he wants to spend more time over it, but because  his nature causes him to need more time. If he made more haste he would  do the ', 'job less well. His speed, then, is determined by subjective causes and  is a factor in the actual duration of the task.  Now if every action in war is allowed its appropriate duration, we would  agree that, at least at first sight, any additional expenditure of time-any  suspension of military action-seems absurd. In this connection it must be  remembered that what we are talking about is not the progress made by one  side or the other but the progress of military interaction as a whole.  If two', ' parties have prepared for war, some motive of hostility must have  brought them to that point. Moreover so long as they remain under arms  (do not negotiate a settlement) that motive of hostility must still be active.  Only one consideration can restrain it: a desire to wait for a better moment  before acting. At first sight one would think this desire could never operate  on more than one side since its opposite must automatically be working on  the other. If action would bring an advantage to', \" one side, the other's interest  must be to wait.  But an absolute balance of forces cannot bring about a standstill, for if  such a balance should exist the initiative would necessarily belong to the side  with the positive purpose-the attacker.  One could, however, conceive of a state of balance in which the side with  the positive aim (the side with the stronger grounds for action) was the  one that had the weaker forces. The balance would then result from the  combined effects of aim and str\", 'ength. Were that the case, one would have  to say that unless some shift in the balance were in prospect the two sides  should make peace. If, however, some alteration were to be foreseen, only  one side could expect to gain by it-a fact which ought to stimulate the  other into action. Inaction clearly cannot be explained by the concept of  balance. The only explanation is that both are waiting for a better time to  act. Let us suppose, therefore, that one of the two states has a positive aim-  ', \"say, the conquest of a part of the other's territory, to use for bargaining at  the peace table. Once the prize is in its hands, the political object has been  achieved; there is no need to do more, and it can let matters rest. If the  other state is ready to accept the situation, it should sue for peace. If not,  it must do something; and if it thinks it will be better organized for action  82  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER ONE  in four weeks' time it clearly ha\", \"s an adequate reason for not taking action  at once.  But from that moment on, logic would seem to call for action by the other  side-the object being to deny the enemy the time he needs for getting  ready. Throughout all this I have assumed, of course, that both sides under-  stand the situation perfectly.  If this continuity were really to exist in the campaign its effect would again  be to drive everything to extremes. Not only would such ceaseless activity  arouse men's feelings and inject t\", 'hem with more passion and elemental  strength, but events would follow more closely on each other and be gov-  erned by a stricter causal chain. Each individual action would be more impor-  tant, and consequently more dangerous.  But war, of course, seldom if ever shows such continuity. In numerous  conflicts only a very small part of the time is occupied by action, while the  rest is spent in inactivity. This cannot always be an anomaly. Suspension of  action in war must be possible; in other w', 'ords, it is not a contradiction in  terms. Let me demonstrate this point, and explain the reasons for it.  By thinking that the interests of the two commanders are opposed in equal  measure to each other, we have assumed a genuine polarity. A whole chapter  will be devoted to the subject further on, but the following must be said  about it here.  The principle of polarity is valid only in relation to one and the same  object, in which positive and negative interests exactly cancel one another  o', 'ut. In a battle each side aims at victory; that is a case of true polarity, since  the victory of one side excludes the victory of the other. When, however,  we are dealing with two different things that have a common relation exter-  nal to themselves, the polaritv lies not in the things but in their relationship.  If war assumed only a single form, namely, attacking the enemy, and defense  were nonexistent; or, to put it in another way, if the only differences between  attack and defense lay i', 'n the fact that attack has a positive aim whereas  defense has not, and the forms of fighting were identical; then every advan-  tage gained by one side would be a precisely equal disadvantage to the  other-true polarity would exist.  8 3  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.ROOK ONE  But there are two distinct forms of action in war: attack and defense. As  will be shown in detail later, the two are very different and unequal in  strength. Polarity, then, does not lie in atta', \"ck or defense, but in the object  both seek to achieve: the decision. If one commander wants to postpone  the decision, the other must want to hasten it, always assuming that both  are engaged in the same kind of fighting. If it is in A's interest not to attack  B now but to attack him in four weeks, then it is in B's interest not to be  attacked in four weeks' time, but now. This is an immediate and direct con-  flict of interest; but it does not follow from this that it would also be to  B's a\", 'dvantage to make an immediate attack on A. That would obviously be  quite another matter.  As we shall show, defense is a stronger form of fighting than attack. Conse-  quently we must ask whether the advantage of postponing a decision is as  great for one side as the advantage of defense is for the other. Whenever it  is not, it cannot balance the advantage of defense and in this way influence  the progress of the war. It is clear, then, that the impulse created by the  polarity of interests ma', 'y be exhausted in the difference between the strength  of attack and defense, and may thus become inoperative.  Consequently, if the side favored by present conditions is not sufficiently  strong to do without the added advantages of the defense, it will have to  accept the prospect of acting under unfavorable conditions in the future.  To fight a defensive battle under these less favorable conditions may still be  better than to attack immediately or to make peace. I am convinced that  the supe', 'riority of the defensive (if rightly understood) is very great, far  greater than appears at first sight. It is this which explains without any  inconsistency most periods of inaction that occur in war. The weaker the  motives for action, the more will they be overlaid and neutralized by this  disparity between attack and defense, and the more frequently will action  be suspended-as indeed experience shows.  There is still another factor that can bring military action to a standstill:  imperfect', \" knowledge of the situation. The only situation a commander can  know fully is his own; his opponent's he can know only from unreliable  intelligence. His evaluation, therefore, may be mistaken and can lead him  to suppose that the initiative lies with the enemy when in fact it remains  with him. Of course such faulty appreciation is as likely to lead to ill-timed  action as to ill-timed inaction, and is no more conducive to slowing down  operations than it is to speeding them up. Nevertheless, \", \"it must rank among  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER ONE  the natural causes which, without entailing inconsistency, can bring military  activity to a halt. Men are always more inclined to pitch their estimate of  the enemy's strength too high than too low, such is human nature. Bear-  ing this in mind, one must admit that partial ignorance of the situation is,  generally speaking, a major factor in delaying the progress of military action  and in moderating the pri\", 'nciple that underlies it.  The possibility of inaction has a further moderating effect on the progress  of the war by diluting it, so to speak, in time by delaying danger, and by  increasing the means of restoring a balance between the two sides. The  greater the tensions that have led to war, and the greater the consequent  war effort, the shorter these periods of inaction. Inversely, the weaker  the motive for conflict, the longer the intervals between actions. For  the stronger motive increas', \"es willpower, and willpower, as we know, is always  both an element in and the product of strength.  The slower the progress and the more frequent the interruptions of military  action the easier it is to retrieve a mistake, the bolder will be the general's  assessments, and the more likely he will be to avoid theoretical extremes and  to base his plans on probability and inference. Any given situation requires  that probabilities be calculated in the light of circumstances, and the amount  of t\", 'ime available for such calculation will depend on the pace with which  operations are taking place.  It is now quite clear how greatly the objective nature of war makes it a  matter of assessing probabilities. Only one more element is needed to make  war a gamble-chance: the very last thing that war lacks. No other human  activity is so continuously or universally bound up with chance. And through  the element of chance, guesswork and luck come to play a great part in war.  If we now consider br', 'iefly the subjective nature of war-the means by which  war has to be fought-it will look more than ever like a gamble. The ele-  ment in which war exists is danger. The highest of all moral qualities in time  of danger is certainly courage. Now courage is perfectly compatible with  prudent calculation but the two differ nonetheless, and pertain to different  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  psychological forces. Daring, on the other hand, boldness, rashness, trust', 'ing  in luck are only variants of courage, and all these traits of character seek  their proper element-chance.  In short, absolute, so-called mathematical, factors never find a firm basis  in military calculations. From the very start there is an interplay of possi-  bilities, probabilities, good luck and bad that weaves its way throughout the  length and breadth of the tapestry. In the whole range of human activities,  war most closely resembles a game of cards.  Although our intellect always ', 'longs for clarity and certainty, our nature  often finds uncertainty fascinating. It prefers to day-dream in the realms of  chance and luck rather than accompany the intellect on its narrow and  tortuous path of philosophical enquiry and logical deduction only to arrive-  hardly knowing how-in unfamiliar surroundings where all the usual land-  marks seem to have disappeared. Unconfined by narrow necessity, it can  revel in a wealth of possibilities; which inspire courage to take wing and  dive i', 'nto the element of daring and danger like a fearless swimmer into the  current.  Should theory leave us here, and cheerfully go on elaborating absolute  conclusions and prescriptions? Then it would be no use at all in real life.  No, it must also take the human factor into account, and find room for cour-  age, boldness, even foolhardiness. The art of war deals with living and with  moral forces. Consequently, it cannot attain the absolute, or certainty it  must always leave a margin for uncerta', 'inty, in the greatest things as much  as in the smallest. With uncertainty in one scale, courage and self-confidence  must be thrown into the other to correct the balance. The greater they are,  the greater the margin that can be left for accidents. Thus courage and self-  confidence are essential in war, and theory should propose only rules that  give ample scope to these finest and least dispensable of military virtues, in  all their degrees and variations. Even in daring there can be method a', 'nd  caution; but here they are measured by a different standard.  Such is war, such is the commander who directs it, and such the theory that  governs it. War is no pastime; it is no mere joy in daring and winning, no  place for irresponsible enthusiasts. It is a serious means to a serious end, and  all its colorful resemblance to a game of chance, all the vicissitudes of pas-  sion, courage, imagination, and enthusiasm it includes are merely its special  characteristics.  When whole communities', ' go to war-whole peoples, and especially  civilized peoples-the reason always lies in some political situation, and the  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER ONE  occasion is always due to some political object. War, therefore, is an act of  policy. Were it a complete, untrammeled, absolute manifestation of violence  (as the pure concept would require), war would of its own independent  will usurp the place of policy the moment policy had brought it into being;  it woul', 'd then drive policy out of office and rule by the laws of its own nature,  very much like a mine that can explode only in the manner or direction pre-  determined by the setting. This, in fact, is the view that has been taken of  the matter whenever some discord between policy and the conduct of war  has stimulated theoretical distinctions of this kind. But in reality things are  different, and this view is thoroughly mistaken. In reality war, as has been  shown, is not like that. Its violence i', 's not of the kind that explodes in a  single discharge, but is the effect of forces that do not always develop in  exactly the same manner or to the same degree. At times they will expand  sufficiently to overcome the resistance of inertia or friction; at others they  are too weak to have any effect. War is a pulsation of violence, variable in  strength and therefore variable in the speed with which it explodes and dis-  charges its energy. War moves on its goal with varying speeds; but it alway', 's  lasts long enough for influence to be exerted on the goal and for its own  course to be changed in one way or another-long enough, in other words,  to remain subject to the action of a superior intelligence. If we keep in mind  that war springs from some political purpose, it is natural that the prime  cause of its existence will remain the supreme consideration in conducting it.  That, however, does not imply that the political aim is a tyrant. It nlust  adapt itself to its chosen means, a p', 'rocess which can radically change it;  yet the political aim remains the first consideration. Policy, then, will per-  meate all military operations, and, in so far as their violent nature will admit,  it will have a continuous influence on them.  We see, therefore, that war is not merely an act of policy but a true political  instrument, a continuation of political intercourse, carried on with other means.  What remains peculiar to war is simply the peculiar nature of its means. War in  general', ', and the commander in any specific instance, is entitled to require that  the trend and designs of policy shall not be inconsistent with these means. That,  of course, is no small demand; but however much it may affect political aims in  a given case, it will never do more than modify them. The political object is the  goal, war is the means of reaching it, and means can never be considered in  isolation from their purpose.  The more powerful and inspiring the motives for war, the more thev aff', \"ect  the belligerent nations and the fiercer the tensions that precede the out-  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  break, the closer will war approach its abstract concept, the more important  will be the destruction of the enemy, the more closely will the military aims  and the political objects of war coincide, and the more military and less  political will war appear to be. On the other hand, the less intense the  motives, the less will the military element's na\", 'tural tendency to violence  coincide with political directives. As a result, war will be driven further from  its natural course, the political object will be more and more at variance  with the aim of ideal war, and the conflict will seem increasingly political in  character.  At this point, to prevent the reader from going astray, it must be observed  that the phrase, the natural tendency of war, is used in its philosophical,  strictly logical sense alone and does not refer to the tendencies o', 'f the forces  that are actually engaged in fighting-including, for instance, the morale and  emotions of the combatants. At times, it is true, these might be so aroused  that the political factor would be hard put to control them. Yet such a  conflict will not occur very often, for if the motivations are so powerful there  must be a policy of proportionate magnitude. On the other hand, if policy  is directed only toward minor objectives, the emotions of the masses will  be little stirred and the', 'y will have to be stimulated rather than held back.  It is time to return to the main theme and observe that while policy is appar-  ently effaced in the one kind of war and yet is strongly evident in the other,  both kinds are equally political. If the state is thought of as a person, and  policy as the product of its brain, then among the contingencies for which  the state must be prepared is a war in which every element calls for policy  to be eclipsed by violence. Only if politics is regarde', 'd not as resulting from  a just appreciation of affairs, but-as it conventionally is-as cautious, devi-  ous, even dishonest, shying away from force, could the second type of war  appear to be more \"political\" than the first.  First, therefore, it is clear that war should never be thought of as something  autonomous but always as an instrument of policy; otherwise the entire his-  tory of war would contradict us. Only this approach will enable us to pene-  trate the problem intelligently. Second', ', this way of looking at it will show  us how wars must vary with the nature of their motives and of the situations  which give rise to them.  The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the  statesman and commander have to make is to establish by that test the kind  of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to  turn it into, something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of all  88  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights res', 'erved.CHAPTER ONE  strategic questions and the most comprehensive. It will be given detailed  study later, in the chapter on war plans.  It is enough, for the moment, to have reached this stage and to have  established the cardinal point of view from which war and the theory of  war have to he examined.  War is more than a true chameleon that slightly adapts its characteristics to  the given case. As a total phenomenon its dominant tendencies always make  war a paradoxical trinity--composed of p', \"rimordial violence, hatred, and  enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; of the play of  chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and  of its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it  subject to reason alone.  The first of these three aspects mainly concerns the people; the second  the commander and his army; the third the government. 'The passions that  are to be kindled in war must already be inherent in the people;\", ' the scope  which the play of courage and talent will enjoy in the realm of probability  and chance depends on the particular character of the commander and the  army; but the political aims are the business of government alone.  These three tendencies are like three different codes of law, deep-rooted  in their subject and yet variable in their relationship to one another. A  theory that ignores any one of them or seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship  between them would conflict with reality ', 'to such an extent that for this  reason alone it would be totally useless.  Our task therefore is to develop a theory that maintains a balance between  these three tendencies, like an object suspended between three magnets.  What lines might best be followed to achieve this difficult task will be  explored in the book on the theory of war [Book Two]. At any rate, the pre-  liminary concept of war which we have formulated casts a first ray of light  on the basic structure of theory, and enables u', 's to make an initial differen-  tiation and identification of its major components.  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER TWO  Purpose and Means in War  The preceding chapter showed that the nature of war is complex and change-  able. I now propose to inquire how its nature influences its purpose and its  means.  If for a start we inquire into the objective of any particular war, which  must guide military action if the political purpose is to be properly served,  we fi', 'nd that the object of any wsr can vary just as much as its political  purpose and its actual circumstances.  If for the moment we consider the pure concept of war, we should have  to say that the political purpose of war had no connection with war itself;  for if war is an act of violence meant to force the enemy to do our will its  aim would have always and solely to be to overcome the enemy and disarm  him. That aim is derived from the theoretical concept of war; but since  many wars do actual', \"ly come very close to fulfilling it, let us examine this  kind of war first of all.  Later, when we are dealing with the subject of war plans, we shall investi-  gate in greater detail what is meant by disarming a country. But we should  at once distinguish between three things, three broad objectives, which  between them cover everything: the armed forces, the country, and the  enemy's will.  The fighting forces m6st be destroyed: that is, they must be put in such a  condition that they can no \", 'longer carry on the fight. Whenever we use the  phrase \"destruction of the enemy\\'s forces\" this alone is what we mean.  The country must be occupied; otherwise the enemy could raise fresh  military forces.  Yet both these things may be done and the war, that is the animosity  and the reciprocal effects of hostile elements, cannot be considered to have  ended so long as the enemy\\'s will has not been broken: in other words, so  long as the enemy government and its allies have not been driven to as', 'k  for peace, or the population made to submit.  We may occupy a country completely, but hostilities can be renewed  again in the interior, or perhaps with allied help. This of course can also  happen after the peace treaty, but this only shows that not every war neces-  sarily leads to a final decision and settlement. But even if hostilities should  occur again, a peace treaty will always extinguish a mass of sparks that might  have gone on quietly smoldering. Further, tensions are slackened, f', 'or lovers  of peace (and they abound among every people under all circumstances)  will then abandon any thought of further action. Be that as it may, we must  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER TWO  always consider that with the conclusion of peace the purpose of the war has  been achieved and its business is at an end.  Since of the three objectives named, it is the fighting forces that assure  the safety of the country, the natural sequence would be to destroy them ', \" first, and then subdue the country. Having achieved these two goals and  exploiting our own position of strength, we can bring the enemy to the  peace table. As a rule, destroying the enemy's forces tends to be a gradual  process, as does the ensuing subjugation of the country. Normally the one  reacts on the other, in that loss of territory weakens the fighting forces; but  that particular sequence of events is not essential and therefore does not  always take place. Before they suffer serious\", \"ly, the enemy's forces may retire  to remote areas, or even withdraw to other countries. In that event, of course,  most or all of the country will be occupied.  But the aim of disarming the enemy (the object of war in the abstract,  the ultimate means of accomplishing the war's political purpose, which  should incorporate all the rest) is in fact not always encountered in reality,  and need not be fully achieved as a condition of peace. On no account  should theory raise it to the level of a la\", 'w. Many treaties have been con-  cluded before one of the antagonists could be called powerless-even before  the balance of power had been seriously altered. What is more, a review of  actual cases shows a whole category of wars in which the very idea of defeat-  ing the enemy is unreal: those in which the enemy is substantially the  stronger power.  The reason why the object of war that emerges in theory is sometimes  inappropriate to actual conflict is that war can be of two very different kin', 'ds,  a point we discussed in the first chapter. If war were what pure theory  postulates, a war between states of markedly unequal strength would be  absurd, and so impossible. At most, material disparity could not go beyond  the amount that moral factors could replace; and social conditions being  what they are in Europe today, moral forces would not go far. But wars  have in fact been fought between states of very unequal strength, for actual  war is often far removed from the pure concept pos', 'tulated by theory.  Inability to carry on the struggle can, in practice, be replaced by two other  grounds for making peace: the first is the improbability of victory; the sec-  ond is its unacceptable cost.  As we saw in the first chapter, war, if taken as a whole, is bound to move  from the strict law of inherent necessity toward probabilities. The more the  circumstances that gave rise to the conflict cause it to do so, the slighter will  be its motives and the tensions which it occasions. An', 'd this makes it under-  standable how an analysis of probabilities may lead to peace itself. Not every  war need be fought until one side collapses. When the motives and tensions  of war are slight we can imagine that the very faintest prospect of defeat  might be enough to cause one side to yield. If from the very start the other  side feels that this is probable, it will obviously concentrate on bringing  about this probability rather than take the long way round and totally defeat  the enemy.', '  9  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  Of even greater influence on the decision to make peace is the conscious-  ness of all the effort that has already been made and of the efforts yet to  come. Since war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its  political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrifices to be  made for it in magnitude and also in duration. Once the expenditure of  effort exceeds the value of the political object,', ' the object must be renounced  and peace must follow.  We see then that if one side cannot completely disarm the other, the  desire for peace on either side will rise and fall with the probability of  further successes and the amount of effort these would require. If such  incentives were of equal strength on both sides, the two would resolve their  political disputes by meeting half way. If the incentive grows on one side,  it should diminish on the other. Peace will result so long as their sum', ' total  is sufficient-though the side that feels the lesser urge for peace will natu-  rally get the better bargain.  One point is purposely ignored for the moment-the difference that the  positive or negative character of the political ends is bound to produce in  practice. As we shall see, the difference is important, but at this stage we  must take a broader view because the original political objects can greatly  alter during the course of the war and may finally change entirely since they  ', \"are influenced by events and their probable consequences.  The question now arises how success can be made more likely. One way,  of course, is to choose objectives that will incidentally bring about the  enemy's collapse-the destruction of his armed forces and the conquest of  his territory; but neither is quite what it would be if our real object were the  total defeat of the enemy. When we attack the enemy, it is one thing if we  mean our first operation to be followed by others until all res\", \"istance has  been broken; it is quite another if our aim is only to obtain a single victory,  in order to make the enemy insecure, to impress our greater strength upon  him, and to give him doubts about his future. If that is the extent of our  aim, we will employ no more strength than is absolutely necessary. In the  same way, conquest of territory is a different matter if the enemy's collapse  is not the object. If we wish to gain total victory, then the destruction of  his armed forces is the\", ' most appropriate action and the occupation of his  territory only a consequence. To occupy land before his armies are defeated  should be considered at best a necessary evil. If on the other hand we do  not aim at destroying the opposing army, and if we are convinced that the  enemy does not seek a brutal decision, but rather fears it, then the seizure  of a lightly held or undefended province is an advantage in itself; and should  this advantage be enough to make the enemy fear for the final o', \"utcome, it  can be considered as a short cut on the road to peace.  But there is another way. It is possible to increase the likelihood of suc-  cess without defeating the enemy's forces. I refer to operations that have  direct political repercussions, that are designed in the first place to disrupt  the opposing alliance, or to paralyze it, that gain us new allies, favorably  affect the political scene, etc. If such operations are possible it is obvious  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All r\", \"ights reserved.CHAPTER TWO  that they can greatly improve our prospects and that they can form a much  shorter route to the goal than the destruction of the opposing armies.  The second question is how to influence the enemy's expenditure of effort;  in other words, how to make the war more costly to him.  The enemy's expenditure of effort consists in the wastage of his forces-  our destruction of them; and in his loss of territory--our conquest.  Closer study will make it obvious that both of t\", 'hese factors can vary in  their significance with the variation in objectives. As a rule the differences will  be slight, but that should not mislead us, for in practice, when strong motives  are not present, the slightest nuances often decide between the different  uses of force. For the moment all that matters is to show that, given certain  conditions, different ways of reaching the objective are possible and that  they are neither inconsistent, absurd, nor even mistaken.  In addition, there ', \"are three other methods directly aimed at increasing  the enemy's expenditure of effort. The first of these is invasion, that is the  seizure of enemy territory; not with the object of retaining it but in order  to exact financial contributions, or even to lay it waste. The immediate object  here is neither to conquer the enemy country nor to destroy its army, but  simply to cause general damage. The second method is to give priority to  operations that will increase the enemy's suffering. It is\", ' easy to imagine two  alternatives: one operation is far more advantageous if the purpose is to  defeat the enemy; the other is more profitable if that cannot be done. The  first tends to be described as the more military, the second the more political  alternative. From the highest point of view, however, one is as military as  the other, and neither is appropriate unless it suits the particular conditions.  The third, and far the most important method, judging from the frequency  of its use, i', 's to wear down the enemy. That expression is more than a label;  it describes the process precisely, and is not so metaphorical as it may seem  at first. Wearing down the enemy in a conflict means using the duration of  the war to bring about u gradual exhaustion of his physical and moral  resistance.  If we intend to hold out longer than our opponent we must be content  with the smallest possible objects, for obviously a major object requires more  effort than a minor one. The minimum object is', \" pure self-defense; in other  words, fighting without a positive purpose. With such a policy our relative  strength will be at its height, and thus the prospects for a favorable outcome  will be greatest. But how far can this negativity be pushed? Obviously not  to the point of absolute passivity, for sheer endurance would not be fighting  at all. But resistance is a form of action, aimed at destroying enough of  the enemy's power to force him to renounce his intentions. Every single  act of our\", ' resistance is directed to that act alone, and that is what makes  our policy negative.  Undoubtedly a single action, assuming it succeeds, would do less for a  negative aim than it would for a positive one. But that is just the difference:  the former is more likely to succeed and so to give you more security. What  it lacks in immediate effectiveness it must make up for in its use of time,  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  that is by prolonging the war. Thus the', ' negative aim, which lies at the heart  of pure resistance, is also the natural formula for outlasting the enemy, for  wearing him down.  Here lies the origin of the distinction that dominates the whole of war:  the difference between attack and defense. We shall not pursue the matter  now, but let us just say this: that from the negative purpose derive all the  advantages, all the more effective forms, of fighting, and that in it is  expressed the dynamic relationship between the magnitude and ', 'the likeli-  hood of success. All this will be gone into later.  If a negative aim-that is, the use of every means available for pure  resistance-gives an advantage in war, the advantage need only be enough  to balance any superiority the opponent may possess: in the end his political  object will not seem worth the effort it costs. He must then renounce his  policy. It is evident that this method, wearing down the enemy, applies to  the great number of cases where the weak endeavor to resist th', \"e strong.  Frederick the Great would never have been able to defeat Austria in the  Seven Years War: and had he tried to fight in the manner of Charles XI1  he would unfailingly have been destroyed himself. But for seven years he  skillfully husbanded his strength and finally convinced the allies that far  greater efforts were needed than they had foreseen. Consequently they made  peace.  We can now see that in war many roads lead to success, and that they  do not all involve the opponent's outr\", \"ight defeat. They range from the  destruction of the enemy's forces, the conquest of his territory, to a tempo-  rary occupation or invasion, to projects with an immediate political purpose,  and finally to passively awaiting the enemy's attacks. Any one of these may  be used to overcome the enemy's will: the choice depends on circumstances.  One further kind of action, of shortcuts to the goal, needs mention: one  could call them arguments ad hominem. Is there a field of human affairs  where pe\", 'rsonal relations do not count, where the sparks they strike do not  leap across all practical considerations? The personalities of statesmen and  soldiers are such important factors that in war above all it is vital not to  underrate them. It is enough to mention this point: it would be pedantic to  attempt a systematic classification. It can be said, however, that these ques-  tions of personality and personal relations raise the number of possible ways  of achieving the goal of policy to infin', \"ity.  To think of these shortcuts as rare exceptions, or to minimize the differ-  ence they can make to the conduct of war, would be to underrate them. To  avoid that error we need only bear in mind how wide a range of political  interests can lead to war, or think for a moment of the gulf that separates  a war of annihilation, a struggle for political existence, from a war reluctantly  declared in consequence of political pressure or of an alliance that no longer  seems to reflect the state's t\", 'rue interests. Between these two extremes lie  numerous gradations. If we reject a single one of them on theoretical  grounds, we may as well reject them all, and lose contact with the real world.  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER TWO  So much then for the ends to be pursued in war; let us now turn to the  means.  There is onlv one: combat. However manv forms combat takes, however  far it may be rimoved from the brute discharge of hatred and enmity of a  physical en', 'counter, however many forces may intrude which themselves are  not part of fighting, it is inherent in the very concept of war that everything  that occurs must originally derive from combat.  It is easy to show that this is always so, however many forms reality takes.  Everything that occurs in war results from the existence of armed forces;  but whenever armed forces, that is armed individuals, are used, the idea of  combat must be present.  Warfare comprises everything related to the fighting', ' forces-everything  to do with their creation. maintenance. and use.  Creation and maintenance are obviously only means; their use constitutes  the end.  Combat in war is not a contest between individuals. It is a whole made  up of many parts, and in that whole two elements may be distinguished,  one determined by the subject, the other by the objective. The mass of  combatants in an army endlessly forms fresh elements, which themselves  are parts of a greater structure. The fighting activity of', ' each of these parts  constitutes a more or less clearly defined element. Moreover, combat itself  is made an element of war by its very purpose, by its objective.  Each of these elements which become distinct in the course of fighting  is named an engagement.  If the idea of fighting underlies every use of the fighting forces, then their  employment means simply the planning and organizing of a series of  engagements.  The whole of military activity must therefore relate directly or indirectly ', ' to the engagement. The end for which a soldier is recruited, clothed, armed,  and trained, the whole object of his sleeping, eating, drinking, and marching  is simply that he should fight at the right place and the right time.  If all threads of military activity lead to the engagement, then if we con-  trol the engagement, we comprehend them all. Their results are produced  by our orders and by the execution of these orders, never directly by other  conditions. Since in the engagement everythi', \"ng is concentrated on the  destruction of the enemy, or rather of his armed forces, which is inherent  in its very concept, it follows that the destruction of the enemy's forces is  always the means by which the purpose of the engagement is achieved.  The purpose in question may be the destruction of the enemy's forces,  but not necessarily so; it may be quite different. As we have shown, the  destruction of the enemy is not the only means of attaining the political  object, when there are other\", ' objectives for which the war is waged. It fol-  lows that those other objectives can also become the purpose of particular  military operations, and thus also the purpose of engagements.  Even when subordinate engagements are directly intended to destroy the  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  opposing forces, that destruction still need not be their first, immediate  concern.  Bearing in mind the elaborate structure of an army, and the numerous  factors that deter', \"mine its emplo!rn~ent, one can see that the fighting activity  of such a force is also subject to complex organization, division of functions,  and combinations. The separate units obviously must often be assigned tasks  that are not in themselves concerned with the destruction of the enemy's  forces, which may indeed increase their losses but do so only indirectly. If  a battalion is ordered to drive the enemy from a hill, a bridge, etc., the true  purpose is normally to occupy that point. Dest\", \"ruction of the enemy's force  is only a means to an end, a secondary matter. If a mere demonstration is  enough to cause the enemy to abandon his position, the objective has been  achieved; but as a rule the hill or bridge is captured only so that even more  damage can be inflicted on the enemy. If this is the case on the battlefield,  it will be even more so in the theater of operations, where it is not merely  two armies that are facing each other, but two states, two peoples, two  nations. Th\", \"e range of possible circumstances, and therefore of options, is  greatly increased, as is the variety of dispositions; and the gradation of  objects at various levels of command will further separate the first means  from the ultimate purpose.  Thus there are many reasons why the purpose of an engagement may not  be the destruction of the enemy's forces, the forces immediately confronting  us. Destruction may be merely a means to some other end. In such a case,  total destruction has ceased to b\", 'e the point; the engagement is nothing but  a trial of strength. In itself it is of no value; its significance lies in the out-  come of the trial.  When one force is a great deal stronger than the other, an estimate may  be enough. There will be no fighting: the weaker side will yield at once.  The fact that engagements do not always aim at the destruction of the  opposing forces, that their objectives can often be attained without any  fighting at all but merely by an evaluation of the situati', 'on, explains why  entire campaigns can be conducted with great energy even though actual  fighting plays an unimportant part in them.  This is demonstrated by hundreds of examples in the history of war. Here  we are only concerned to show that it is possible; we need not ask how often  it was appropriate, in other words consistent with the overall purpose, to  avoid the test of battle, or whether all the reputations made in such cam-  paigns would stand the test of critical examination.  There i', \"s only one means in war: combat. But the multiplicity of forms  that combat assumes leads us in as many different directions as are created  by the multiplicity of aims, so that our analysis does not seem to have made  any progress. But that is not so: the fact that only one means exists consti-  tutes a strand that runs through the entire web of military activity and really  holds it together.  We have shown that the destruction of the enemy's forces is one of the  many objects that can be purs\", \"ued in war, and we have left aside the ques-  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER TWO  tion of its importance relative to other purposes. In any given case the  answer will depend on circumstances; its importance to war in general  remains to be clarified. We shall now go into this question, and we shall  see what value must necessarily be attributed to this object of destruction.  Combat is the only effective force in war; its aim is to destroy the enemy's  forces as \", \"a means to a further end. That holds good even if no actual fighting  occurs, because the outcome rests on the assumption that if it came to fight-  ing, the enemy would be destroyed. It follows that the destruction of the  enemy's force underlies all military actions; all plans are ultimately based  on it, resting on it like an arch on its abutment. Consequently, all action  is undertaken in the belief that if the ultimate test of arms should actually  occur, the outcome would be favorable. The\", ' decision by arms is for all major  and minor operations in war what cash payment is in commerce. Regardless  how complex the relationship between the two parties, regardless how rarely  settlements actually occur, thev can never be entirely absent.  If a decision by-fighting is the basis of all plans and operations, it follows  that the enemy can frustrate everything through a successful battle. This  occurs not only when the encounter affects an essential factor in our plans,  but when any vic', 'tory that is won is of sufficient scope. For every important  victory-that is, destruction of opposing forces-reacts on all other possi-  bilities. Like liquid, they will settle at a new level.  Thus it is evihent that destruction of the enemy forces is always the supe-  rior, more effective means, with which others cannot compete.  But of course, we can only say destruction of the enemy is more effective  if we can assume that all other conditions are equal. It would be a great  mistake to dedu', \"ce from this argument that a headlong rush must always  triumph over skillful caution. ~Cnd aggressiveness would destroy the attack  itself,-not the defense, and this is not-what we are talking about. Greater  effectiveness relates not to the means but to the end; we are simply compar-  ing the effect of different outcomes.  When we speak of destroying the enemy's forces we must emphasize that  nothing obliges us to limit this idea to physical forces: the moral element  must also be considered. \", 'The two interact throughout: they are inseparable.  We have just mentioned the effect that a great destructive act-a major  victory-inevitably exerts on all other actions, and it is exactly at such times  that the moral factor is, so to speak, the most fluid element of all, and there-  fore spreads most easily to affect everything else. The advantage that the  destruction of the enemy possesses over all other means is balanced by its  cost and danger; and it is only in order to avoid these risks', \" that other policies  are employed.  That the method of destruction cannot fail to be expensive is under-  standable; other things being equal, the more intent we are on destroying  theenemy's forces, the greater our own efforts must be.  The danger of this method is that the greater the success we seek, the  greater will be the damage if we fail.  Other methods, therefore, are less costly if they succeed and less damag-  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.BOOK ONE  ing if th\", \"ey fail, though this holds true only if both sides act identically, if  the enemy pursues the same course as we do. If he were to seek the decision  through a major battle, his choice would force us against our will to do like-  wise. Then the outcome of the battle would be decisive; but it is clear-  other things again being equal-that we would be at an overall disadvantage,  since our plans and resources had been in part intended to achieve other  goals, whereas the enemy's were not. Two objec\", 'tives, neither of which is part  of the other, are mutually exclusive: one force cannot simultaneously be used  for both. If, therefore, one of the two commanders is resolved to seek a  decision through major battles, he will have an excellent chance of success  if he is certain that his opponent is pursuing a different policy. Conversely,  the commander who wishes to adopt different means can reasonably do so  only if he assumes his opponent to be equally unwilling to resort to major  battles. ', \" What has been said about plans and forces being directed to other uses  refers only to the positive purposes, other than the destruction of enemy  forces, that can be pursued in war. It pertains in no way to pure resistance,  which seeks to wear down the opponent's strength. Pure resistance has no  positive intention; we can use our forces only to frustrate the enemy's inten-  tions, and not divert them to other objectives.  Here we must consider the negative side of destroying the enemy's  for\", \"ces-that is, the preservation of our own. These two efforts always go  together; they interact. They are integral parts of a single purpose, and we  only need to consider the result if one or the other dominates. The effort  to destroy the enemy's forces has a positive purpose and leads to positive  results, whose final aim is the enemy's collapse. Preserving our own forces  has a negative purpose; it frustrates the enemy's intentions-that is, it  amounts to pure resistance, whose ultimate aim c\", 'an only be to prolong the  war until the enemy is exhausted.  The policy with a positive purpose calls the act of destruction into being;  the policy with a negative purpose waits for it.  How far such a waiting attitude may or should be maintained is a ques-  tion we shall study in connection with the theory of attack and defense,  whose basic element is here involved. For the moment we need only say  that a policy of waiting must never become passive endurance, that any  action involved in it ', 'may just as well seek the destruction of the opposing  forces as any other objective. It would be a fundamental error to imagine  that a negative aim implies a preference for a bloodless decision over the  destruction of the enemy. A preponderantly negative effort may of course  lead to such a choice, but always at the risk that it is not the appropriate  course: that depends on factors that are determined not by us but by the  opponent. Avoidance of bloodshed, then, should not be taken as an ac', 't of  policy if our main concern is to preserve our forces. On the contrary, if such  a policy did not suit the particular situation it would lead our forces to  disaster. A great many generals have failed through this mistaken assumption.  The one certain effect a preponderantly negative policy will have is to  Copyright © ${Date}. ${Publisher}. All rights reserved.CHAPTER TWO  retard the decision: in other words, action is transposed into waiting for the  decisive moment. This usually means th', 'at action is postponed in time and  space to the extent that space is relevant and circun~stances permit. If the  time arrives when further waiting would bring excessive disadvantages, then  the benefit of the negative policy has been exhausted. The destruction of  the enemy-an aim that has until then been postponed but not displaced  by another consideration-now reemerges.  Our discussion has shown that while in war many different roads can  lead to the goal, to the attainment of the political ', \"object, fighting is the onlv  possible means. Everything is governed by a supreme law, the decision by  force of arms. If the opponent does seek battle, this recourse can never be  denied him. A commander who prefers another strategy must first be sure  that his opponent either will not appeal to that supreme tribunal-force-  or that he will lose the verdict if he does. To sum up: of all the possible  aims in war, the destruction of the enemy's armed forces always appears as  the highest.  At a \", \"later stage and by degrees we shall see what other kinds of strategies  can achieve in war. All we need to do for the moment is to admit the gen-  eral possibility of their existence, the possibility of deviating from the basic  concept of war under the pressure of special circumstances. But even at this  point we must not fail to emphasize that the violent resolution of the crisis,  the wish to annihilate the enemy's forces, is the first-born son of war. If the  political aims are small, the mo\", \"tives slight and tensions low, a prudent gen-  eral may look for any way to avoid major crises and decisive actions, exploit  any weaknesses in the opponent's military and political strategy, and finally  reach a peaceful settlement. If his assumptions are sound and promise suc-  cess we are not entitled to criticize him. But he must never forget that he  is moving on devious paths where the god of war may catch him unawares.  He must always keep an eye on his opponent so that he does not, if th\", 'e latter  has taken up a sharp sword, approach him armed only with an ornamental rapier.  These conclusions concerning the nature of war and the function of its  purposes and means; the manner in which war in practice deviates in vary-  ing degrees from its basic, rigorous concept, taking this form or that, but  always remaining subject to that basic concept, as to a supreme law; all  these points must be kept in mind in our subsequent analyses if we are to  perceive the real connections between', ' all aspects of war, and the true sig-  nificance of each; and if we wish to avoid constantly falling into the wildest  inconsistencies with reality and even with our own arguments.
